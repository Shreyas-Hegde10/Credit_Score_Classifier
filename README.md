** Project Description**

This project utilizes a Random Forests Classifier to decide whether your credit score is Good, Standard, or Bad. The classification is based upon 11 features: Age, Annual Income, Monthly Inhand Salary, Number of Bank Accounts, Number of Credit Cards, Interest Rate, Number of Loans, Delay from Due Date, Credit Mix, Credit History Age, Monthly Balance.
In terms of exploratory data analysis, I used Plotly Express due to its interactive graphs. For hyperparameter optimization, I used the Optuna framework for its speed & efficiency in finding the best hyperparameters. Currently, the model has a training accuracy of 99.9% and a test accuracy of 80.7%. I will run more Optuna trials to find a better set
of hyperparameters. The webapp was deployed using Streamlit.
